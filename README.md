# Note

This branch is set up for automated conversion. See [this README](https://github.com/plum-umd/checkedc-eval-vsftpd/blob/re-port/README.md) for instructions on how to use it.

# About

This CheckedC version of parson is a fork of the parson JSON parsing library by kgabis (<https://github.com/kgabis/parson)>). The code is converted into CheckedC to provide bounds guarantees from the compiler (see <https://github.com/Microsoft/checked-c> for more information). DO **NOT** USE THIS CODE IN PRODUCTION. It is not kept up to date with the main parson project.

# Usage

Requires the checkedc-clang compiler (<https://github.com/Microsoft/checkedc-clang>) to build. If that is not aliased to `clang` on your system, edit the Makefile to set CC appropriately.

To build only: `make compile`

To build and then run the unit tests: `make` or `make test`

# Branches

`baseline`: The original C code that the conversion starts from. Note that this is already behind the main parson project. This is the version used in Azure's IOT C SDK as of July 2018. This branch should pass all 325 unit tests.

`re-port`: Updated version of the baseline that prepares the .c files for automated conversion using the Checked-C-convert tool. 

`master`: The converted CheckedC code.
